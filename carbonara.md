# Classic Spaghetti Carbonara

## Ingredients:
- 400g (14 oz) spaghetti
- 150g (5 oz) pancetta or guanciale, diced
- 3 large eggs
- 1 cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese
- 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- Salt and black pepper to taste
- Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)

## Instructions:

1. **Cook the Spaghetti:**
   - Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
   - Cook the spaghetti according to the package instructions until al dente. Reserve a cup of pasta cooking water before draining.

2. **Prepare the Sauce:**
   - In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, grated Pecorino Romano, and Parmesan cheese. Set aside.

3. **Cook Pancetta or Guanciale:**
   - In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the diced pancetta or guanciale until it becomes crispy and golden brown. Add minced garlic and saut√© briefly until fragrant.

4. **Combine Everything:**
   - Add the cooked and drained spaghetti to the skillet with pancetta. Toss to coat the pasta in the rendered fat.
   - Remove the skillet from heat and quickly pour the egg and cheese mixture over the spaghetti. Toss vigorously to create a creamy sauce. If the sauce is too thick, add a bit of the reserved pasta cooking water to reach the desired consistency.

5. **Season and Serve:**
   - Season the carbonara with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.
   - Garnish with chopped fresh parsley.

6. **Serve Immediately:**
   - Carbonara is best served immediately to enjoy the creamy texture of the sauce.
